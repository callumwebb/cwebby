I'm a data scientist and engineer, and have been fortunate to experience a diverse range of work. Some things I've been a part of include:

- [BibliU](https://bibliu.com/), a learning enablement platform
- [APRA](https://www.apra.gov.au/), one of Australia's financial regulators
- optimising copper mining operation and extraction processes
- an augmented reality app for mine planning
- [autonomous mining haul trucks](https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/nobody-at-the-wheel-at-bhps-jimblebar-iron-ore-mine-site-ng-b88529442z)
- heavy haul railway maintenance
- pilot program and first two years of [CoderDojo WA](http://coderdojowa.org.au/)
- [hipflask](https://www.hipflaskapp.com/)
- early development of a mountain bike [suspension tuning system](https://www.quarq.com/)

This site was put together to learn more about topics I find interesting and practice publishing content from R and D3 with automated build processes. Hopefully you find it interesting and useful too!

Some tools used include [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) for R, with a slightly modified theme from [Bootstrapious](https://github.com/kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme).
