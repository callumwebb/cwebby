I'm a data scientist and engineer, currently building data products at 
[BibliU](https://bibliu.com/). In the past I've worked on: 

- [financial regulation](https://www.apra.gov.au/)
- copper extraction
- [autonomous mining trucks](https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/nobody-at-the-wheel-at-bhps-jimblebar-iron-ore-mine-site-ng-b88529442z)
- heavy haul railway maintenance
- [mentoring kids who want to learn how to code](http://coderdojowa.org.au/)

And other software development in Python, Objective C, and C++. Outside of work I enjoy photography, keeping fit, and eating chocolate.

[This site](https://github.com/callumwebb/cwebby) was put together to learn more about topics I find interesting and practice publishing content from R. Hopefully you find it interesting and useful too!
